Learning and practicing the lovely Rust ğŸ¦€ through making a URL Shortener service that I use

## TODOs:
 - create a simple web server
 - (add Redis to one of the machines and) integrate Redis client
 - automated CI/CD; when a feature branch is merged after a PR, automated CI/CD is triggered, and will deploy the new version to the machine
   - can use Github Actions for that
 - add business logic
